# General Layout System
`gls` is a general purpose maintainable and simple layout componets for react 🌹. 

# Basic concepts
There are two key concepts to maintainable layout in the world of components, one is *airspace*, the other is *flex*. Lets tackle them one by one: 

## Airspace
A fundamental rule (broken quite commonly in the wild sadly) is that a component only renders stuff in its airspace. That is, it does not bleed out resulting in conflicts with its neighbours. 

Consider a simple'ol `div`. We'll give it a background to denote its airspace. It can render whatever it wants in its airspace: 

<Playground>
  <div style={{backgroundColor: 'aqua'}}>Hello world</div>
</Playground>

Now try and layout two of these divs together

# How to generate whitespace

* TODO: talk about margins being unmaintainable. Talk about airspace.
* TODO: talk about flex allowing for dynamic displays.

# Components
You can now jump to individual docs for the components using the sidebar 👍🏻.
