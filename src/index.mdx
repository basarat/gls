# General Layout System
`gls` is a general purpose maintainable and simple layout componets for react üåπ. 

# Basic concepts
There are a few key concepts to maintainable layout in the world of components, *external airspace*, *flexible expansion* and *internal airspace*. Lets tackle them one by one: 

## External Airspace
A fundamental rule (broken quite commonly in the wild sadly) is that a component only renders stuff in its airspace. That is, it does not bleed out resulting in conflicts with its neighbours. 

Consider a simple'ol `div`. We'll give it a background `lightskyblue` to denote its airspace. It can render whatever it wants in its airspace: 

<Playground style={{ backgroundColor: "#eee", margin: '-2em', padding: '2em' }}>
  <div style={{backgroundColor: 'lightskyblue'}}>Hello</div>
</Playground>

Now try and layout two of these divs together, a naive way would be to add margins:  

<Playground style={{ backgroundColor: "#eee", margin: '-2em', padding: '2em' }}>
  <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue", marginBottom: '24px'}}>Hello</div>
  <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink", marginBottom: '24px'}}>World</div>
  <div style={{backgroundColor: "darkorange"}}>Spacing</div>
</Playground>

A fundamental issue with `<div style={{marginBottom: '24px'}}>Hello</div>` component, is that its not useable in isolation. If we render it alone, note that its leaking out *assuming* its going to be used by something that's going to add another sibling after it: 

<Playground style={{ backgroundColor: "#eee", margin: '-2em', padding: '2em' }}>
  <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue", marginBottom: '24px'}}>Hello</div>
  <i style={{position:'absolute', bottom:'30px'}}>Notice that excess space at the bottom</i>
</Playground>

So instead of putting the responsiblity of *space seperation* on the component, it can be better managed by the container, e.g. Here the container will space each of its children (except the last) using `margin-bottom`: 

```css
parent>* {
  marginBottom: spacing
}
parent>*:last-child {
  marginBottom: 0px,
}
```

Such a container is the `Vertical` component provided by gls. You can see it seperate the children below:

<Playground style={{ backgroundColor: "#eee", margin: '-2em', padding: '2em' }}>
  <Vertical>
    <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>Hello</div>
    <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink"}}>World</div>
    <div style={{backgroundColor: "darkorange"}}>Spacing</div>
  </Vertical>
</Playground>

And no leaking margins occur with lesser children:

<Playground style={{ backgroundColor: "#eee", margin: '-2em', padding: '2em' }}>
  <Vertical>
    <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>Hello</div>
    <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink"}}>World</div>
  </Vertical>
</Playground>

Furthermore the `Vertical` component itself doesn't bleed into external airspace, allowing you to compose two `Vertical`s seamlessly: 

<Playground style={{ backgroundColor: "#eee", margin: '-2em', padding: '2em' }}>
  <Vertical>
    <Vertical>
      <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>Hello</div>
      <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink"}}>World</div>
    </Vertical>
    <Vertical>
      <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>Second Hello</div>
      <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink"}}>Second World</div>
    </Vertical>
  </Vertical>
</Playground>

Because `margin`s fundamentally result in airspace violation, do not use margins at the root of your components.

> RULE 1: DO NOT USE MARGIN AT THE ROOT OF YOUR COMPONENT

This rule is also what makes it possible for parents to space children with margins.

## Flexible expansion

* TODO: Talk about column grid driven layouts, show their issue and then talk about flex allowing for dynamic displays. 

> RULE 2: USE FLEX INSTEAD OF COLUMN-COUNT FOR EXPANSION

## Internal Airspace Management

* TODO: talk about padding
