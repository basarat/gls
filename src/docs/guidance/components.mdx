# Component Concepts

> This section is in a [series of sections that provide further guidance for success][guidance].

Following the [sizing principle][principle-sizing] there are three categories of **defaults** you should follow in components 

- [Explicit Size](#explicit-size)
- [Content Sizing](#content-sizing)
- [Flex Sizing](#flex-sizing)


## Explicit Size 

> If a component exists to present an explicitly sized piece of information, then it should take explicit `SizeProps`.

Explicit size is rare, but still plays an active part in UI design. 

An example would be a profile display picture component where you want to set the width and the height to ensure the image takes up a particular space even before the image (content) is loaded. Notice the explicit `width` and `height` in the `style`

```ts
export const DemoProfile: React.FC<{ size: number }> = ({ size }) => {
  return (
    <img
      style={{
        borderRadius: '50%',
        // Explicit size
        width: `${size}px`,
        height: `${size}px`,
      }}
      src={`http://placekitten.com/g/${size}/${size}`} />
  );
}
```

<Playground>
  <demos.DemoProfile size={100}/>
</Playground>

## Content Sizing 
Content sizing is the most common form of sizing in designs out there. 

> If a component exists only to present the **dynamic amount of content** it contains, then it should be *content* by default.

You normally don't need to do anything special for the browsers to reliably size your items by content. 

Examples: 
- Links (`a`)
- Buttons (`button`)
- Typography (`h1,h2,...,p,li,ul` etc)

## Flex Sizing

> If a component is going to occupy a significant portion of user's interaction time, then it should be flex by default. 

When you think of default flex sizing, you normally need to thing about direction (horizontal / vertical) as well. 

### Horizontal examples
- `input`
- `select` 
- `textarea` (horizontal flex, with vertical drag enabled)

### Vertical examples 
- page body
