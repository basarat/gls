# Component Concepts

Following the [sizing principle][principle-sizing] there are three categories of **defaults** you should follow in components 

- Explicit Size
- Flex Sizing
- Content Sizing

## Explicit Size 

Explicit size is rare, but still plays an active part in UI design. 

An example would be a profile display picture component where you want to set the width and the height to ensure the image takes up a particular space even before the image (content) is loaded. Notice the explicit `width` and `height` in the `style`

```ts
export const DemoProfile: React.FC<{ size: number }> = ({ size }) => {
  return (
    <img
      style={{
        borderRadius: '50%',
        // Explicit size
        width: `${size}px`,
        height: `${size}px`,
      }}
      src={`http://placekitten.com/g/${size}/${size}`} />
  );
}
```

<Playground>
  <demos.DemoProfile size={100}/>
</Playground>
