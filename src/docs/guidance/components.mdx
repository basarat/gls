# Component Concepts

Following the [sizing principle][principle-sizing] there are three categories of **defaults** you should follow in components 

- [Explicit Size](#explicit-size)
- [Content Sizing](#content-sizing)
- Flex Sizing


## Explicit Size 

Explicit size is rare, but still plays an active part in UI design. 

An example would be a profile display picture component where you want to set the width and the height to ensure the image takes up a particular space even before the image (content) is loaded. Notice the explicit `width` and `height` in the `style`

```ts
export const DemoProfile: React.FC<{ size: number }> = ({ size }) => {
  return (
    <img
      style={{
        borderRadius: '50%',
        // Explicit size
        width: `${size}px`,
        height: `${size}px`,
      }}
      src={`http://placekitten.com/g/${size}/${size}`} />
  );
}
```

<Playground>
  <demos.DemoProfile size={100}/>
</Playground>

## Content Sizing 
Content sizing is the most common form of sizing in designs out there. 

> Before creating a component you just have to ask yourself *Do I want this component to be sized by its content?*

You normally don't need to do anything special for the browsers to reliably size your items by content. 

Examples: 
- Links (`a`)
- Buttons (`button`)
- Typography (`h1,h2,...,p,li,ul` etc)
