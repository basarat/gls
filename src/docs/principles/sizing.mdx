# Sizing
The ability to control the sizing of a container is what fundamentally makes it possible to mix *explicit sized* (simple) / *flex sized* (powerful) and *flexible* (super-powerful) layout items in your designs. We cover them one by one below.


## Explicit sized
Driven by explicit `width,height` arguments. Here we have a simple `Vertical` container with explicit `height`: 

<Playground>
  <Vertical height={100} style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>
    Hello world
  </Vertical>
</Playground>


This is essentially what you are doing in most design tools out there. Sadly explicit sizing does not scale to *real* applications where sizes need to be reactive to either their parent or their content. Fortunately we provide concepts to handle these cases.

## Flex sized
A flex sized component takes up as much space as offered by the parent. 


Here we have an explicit sized `Vertical` (background `darkorange`) with an inner flex sized `Vertical` (background `lightskyblue`). The inner vertical keeps it size to match that of the outer container

# Content sized
