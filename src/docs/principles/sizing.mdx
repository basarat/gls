# Sizing
When thinking about the size of a container you need to think about *explicit* size and *implicit* sizing. We cover these concepts below.

## SizeProps (Explicit size)

```ts
/** 
 * Add support for explicit sizing
 */
export interface SizeProps {
  height?: CSSLength,
  minHeight?: CSSLength,
  maxHeight?: CSSLength,

  width?: CSSLength,
  minWidth?: CSSLength,
  maxWidth?: CSSLength,
}
```

Explicit sizes are driven by `width,height,minHeight,minWidth` arguments. You can have an explicit value on only one dimension e.g. here we have a simple `Vertical` container with explicit `height` only: 

<Playground>
  <Vertical height={100} style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>
    Hello world
  </Vertical>
</Playground>


This is essentially what you are doing in most design tools out there. Sadly explicit `height+width` sizing does not scale to *real* applications where sizes need to be reactive to either their parent or their content. Fortunately we provide concepts to handle these cases with ***implicit sizing*** concepts we cover next.


## SizingProp (Implicit sizing)
The `SizingProp` is what controls the implicit sizing (content / flex / flex-ratio) features: 

```ts
/** 
 * Specifies sizing interaction
 */
export interface SizingProp {
  /** 
   * Specifies `sizing` interaction
   */
  sizing?:
  | 'content' /** default */
  | 'flex' /** Same as `1` */
  | number /** A flex ratio */;
}
```

We cover these individually below:

### Content sized
A content sized component takes up as much space as needed by the children. This is the most common sizing that you want and is therefore the default for our containers.

In the example below, we have an explicit sized `Vertical` (background `lightskyblue`) with an inner content-sized `Vertical` (background `darkorange`). The inner vertical keeps it size to match whatever is needed by its children (observed below as you see the background of the parent where the child ends)

<Playground>
  <Vertical height={100} style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>
    <Vertical style={{backgroundColor: "darkorange"}}>
        I'm taking up as much space as needed by my children
    </Vertical>  
  </Vertical>
</Playground>

> You can set it explicitly as well if you want `sizing={'content'}`

### Flex sized
A flex sized component takes up as much space as offered by the parent. 

In the example below, we have an explicit sized `Vertical` (background `lightskyblue`) with an inner flex sized `Vertical` (background `darkorange`). The inner vertical keeps its size to match that of the outer container (observed below as you don't see the background of the parent as it is filled in by the child).

<Playground>
  <Vertical height={100} style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>
    <Vertical sizing={'flex'} style={{backgroundColor: "darkorange"}}>
        I'm taking up all the space from the parent
    </Vertical>  
  </Vertical>
</Playground>

### Flex sized ratios
With flex sizing, you can specify `number` values. This controls how much you want different items dividing the space provided by their parent. e.g. We have `1` and `2` as the sizing on the children of the following horizontal:

<Playground>
  <Horizontal height={100} spacing={0} style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>
    <Flex sizing={1} style={{backgroundColor: "darkorange"}}>
        I'm taking 1
    </Flex>  
    <Flex sizing={2} style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink"}}>
        I'm taking 2
    </Flex>
  </Horizontal>
</Playground>

## Mixing

You can mix `Flex`, `Content` and explicit sizing to match your design requirements as shown in the example below (`explicit,content,flex 1,flex 2`):

<Playground>
  <Horizontal height={100} spacing={0} style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>
    <Content width={100} style={{backgroundColor: "limegreen"}}>Exactly 100px</Content>
    <Content style={{backgroundColor: "gold"}}>As much as I need</Content>
    <Flex sizing={1} style={{backgroundColor: "darkorange"}}>
        I'm taking 1 from remainder
    </Flex>  
    <Flex sizing={2} style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink"}}>
        I'm taking 2 from remainder
    </Flex>
  </Horizontal>
</Playground>
