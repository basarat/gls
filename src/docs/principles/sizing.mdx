# Sizing
The ability to control the sizing of a container is what fundamentally makes it possible to mix *explicit sized* (simple) / *flex sized* (powerful) and *content* (super-powerful) layout items in your designs. We cover them one by one below.

## SizeProps 

```ts
/** 
 * Add support for explicit sizing
 */
export interface SizeProps {
  height?: CSSLength,
  minHeight?: CSSLength,
  maxHeight?: CSSLength,

  width?: CSSLength,
  minWidth?: CSSLength,
  maxWidth?: CSSLength,
}
```

Explicit sizes are driven by `width,height,minHeight,minWidth` arguments. You can have an explicit value on only one dimension e.g. here we have a simple `Vertical` container with explicit `height` only: 

<Playground>
  <Vertical height={100} style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>
    Hello world
  </Vertical>
</Playground>


This is essentially what you are doing in most design tools out there. Sadly explicit `height+width` sizing does not scale to *real* applications where sizes need to be reactive to either their parent or their content. Fortunately we provide concepts to handle these cases with *sizing* concepts we cover next.


## SizingProp 
The `SizingProp` is what controls the implicit sizing content / flex / flex-ratio features: 

```ts
/** 
 * Specifies sizing interaction
 */
export interface SizingProp {
  /** 
   * Specifies `sizing` interaction
   */
  sizing?:
  | 'content' /** default */
  | 'flex' /** Same as `1` */
  | number /** A flex ratio */;
}
```

We cover these individually below:

### Flex sized
A flex sized component takes up as much space as offered by the parent. 

In the example below, we have an explicit sized `Vertical` (background `lightskyblue`) with an inner flex sized `Vertical` (background `darkorange`). The inner vertical keeps its size to match that of the outer container (observed below as you don't see the background of the parent as it is filled in by the child).

<Playground>
  <Vertical height={100} style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>
    <Vertical sizing={'flex'} style={{backgroundColor: "darkorange"}}>
        I'm taking up all the space from the parent
    </Vertical>  
  </Vertical>
</Playground>


### Content sized
A content sized component takes up as much space as needed by the children. This is the most common sizing that you want and is therefore the default.

In the example below, we have an explicit sized `Vertical` (background `lightskyblue`) with an inner content-sized `Vertical` (background `darkorange`). The inner vertical keeps it size to match whatever is needed by its children (observed below as you see the background of the parent where the child ends)

<Playground>
  <Vertical height={100} style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>
    <Vertical style={{backgroundColor: "darkorange"}}>
        I'm taking up as much space as needed by my children
    </Vertical>  
  </Vertical>
</Playground>

> You can set it explicitly as well if you want `sizing={'content'}`

### Flex sized ratios
With flex sizing, you can specify `number` values on how much you want differnt items to flex. e.g. We have `1` and `2` as the sizing on the children of the following horizontal:

<Playground>
  <Horizontal height={100} spacing={0} style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>
    <Flex sizing={1} style={{backgroundColor: "darkorange"}}>
        I'm taking 1
    </Flex>  
    <Flex sizing={2} style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink"}}>
        I'm taking 2
    </Flex>
  </Horizontal>
</Playground>

You can even mix `Flex`, `Content` and explicit sizing if you want: 

<Playground>
  <Horizontal height={100} spacing={0} style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>
    <Content width={100} style={{backgroundColor: "limegreen"}}>Exactly 100px</Content>
    <Content style={{backgroundColor: "gold"}}>As much as I need</Content>
    <Flex sizing={1} style={{backgroundColor: "darkorange"}}>
        I'm taking 1 from remainder
    </Flex>  
    <Flex sizing={2} style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink"}}>
        I'm taking 2 from remainder
    </Flex>
  </Horizontal>
</Playground>
