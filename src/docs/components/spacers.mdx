# Spacers 

Spacers are used to add *space* to your designs. Spacers should not be abused, but they can be super handy. Consider a simple button on the screen: 

<Playground>
  <demos.Button>
    Just a button minding its own business
  </demos.Button>
</Playground>  

Let's say the design wants you to add some space on top of the button. You can do that easily with `margin-top`: 

<Playground>
  <demos.Button style={{marginTop: '25px'}}>
    Just a button minding its own business
  </demos.Button>
</Playground>  

We've covered issues with using margin (specifically their collapsing nature which makes them hard to manage and maintain reliably) in our [spacing-principle][principle-spacing]. Another issue is in the future this `marginTop` can easily get lost in code reviews. 

So instead you can use a simple spacer, which doesn't collapse (i.e. magically disappear), and shows up in code reviews: 

<Playground>
  <VerticalSpace space={25}/>
  <demos.Button>
    Just a button minding its own business
  </demos.Button>
</Playground>
