# Spacer

Spacers add *space* to your designs. Spacers should not be abused, but they can be super handy. Consider a simple button on the screen: 

<Playground>
  <demos.Button>
    Just a button minding its own business
  </demos.Button>
</Playground>  

Let's say the design wants you to add some space on top of the button. You can do that easily with `margin-top`: 

<Playground>
  <demos.Button style={{marginTop: '25px'}}>
    Just a button minding its own business
  </demos.Button>
</Playground>  

We've covered issues with using margin (specifically their collapsing nature and cross component dependencies, which makes them hard to manage and maintain reliably) in our [spacing-principle][principle-spacing]. Another issue is that `marginTop` can easily get lost in code reviews. 

So instead you can use a simple `VerticalSpacer`, which doesn't collapse (i.e. magically disappear), and shows up in code reviews: 

<Playground>
  <VerticalSpacer space={25}/>
  <demos.Button>
    Just a button minding its own business
  </demos.Button>
</Playground>  

# HorizontalSpacer
Takes the `space?:CSSLength` prop to generate a horizontal space. e.g. you can see the button pushed a bit to the right by a `HorizontalSpacer`: 

<Playground>
  <HorizontalSpacer space={25}/>
  <demos.Button>
    Just a button minding its own business
  </demos.Button>
</Playground>  

# VerticalSpacer
Takes the `space?:CSSLength` prop to generate a vertical space. e.g. you can see the button pushed a bit to the bottom by a `VerticalSpacer`: 

<Playground>
  <VerticalSpacer space={25}/>
  <demos.Button>
    Just a button minding its own business
  </demos.Button>
</Playground>  

# FlexSpacer 
Takes the `sizing?:number` prop ([flex ratio concept covered in sizing principle][principle-sizing]) to generate a flex amount of space.

`FlexSpacer` comes really handy when you want to split items to the sides (left & right) with a flex space in between as shown below:

<Playground>
  <Horizontal>
    <demos.Button>
      On left
    </demos.Button>
    <FlexSpacer/>
    <demos.Button>
      On right
    </demos.Button>
  </Horizontal>
</Playground>

`FlexSpacer` works automatically for both horizontal and vertical dimensions depending on the parent container. The following two examples demonstrate it with `Vertical(FlexSpacer,Button)` and `Horizontal(FlexSpacer,Button)`: 

<Playground>
  <Vertical height={100}>
    <FlexSpacer/>
    <demos.Button>
      Just a button minding its own business
    </demos.Button>
  </Vertical>
</Playground>

<Playground>
  <Horizontal>
    <FlexSpacer/>
    <demos.Button>
      Just a button minding its own business
    </demos.Button>
  </Horizontal>
</Playground>

Note that when don't want to split items (all child items are grouped together), you can use the [alignment properties][common-types] on `Vertical`/`Horizontal` to achieve the same effect (no `FlexSpacer` in the below example):

<Playground>
  <Horizontal horizontalAlign='right'>
    <demos.Button>
      Just a button minding its own business
    </demos.Button>
  </Horizontal>
</Playground>
