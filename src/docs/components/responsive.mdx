# Responsive 

Lays out children in a vertically or horizontally spaced layout based on given breakpoint.

<Playground>
  <Vertical>
    <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>Hello</div>
    <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink"}}>World</div>
  </Vertical>
</Playground>

Since `Vertical` follows the [spacing principle][principle-spacing] you can compose / nest `Vertical`s easily. The following example has three `Verticals` in a `Vertical(Vertical(blue,pink),Vertical(blue,pink))` heirarchy but to the user it looks seemless. This ability to nest allows you to easily create and reuse components without having to worry about how they will get used.

<Playground>
  <Vertical>
    <Vertical>
      <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>Hello</div>
      <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink"}}>World</div>
    </Vertical>
    <Vertical>
      <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>Second Hello</div>
      <div style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink"}}>Second World</div>
    </Vertical>
  </Vertical>
</Playground>
