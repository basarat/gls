# Responsive 

Lays out children in a vertically or horizontally spaced layout based on given breakpoint (default is 480). 

> You'll have to resize the browser window to see the following examples in action üëç

As an example, resize your browser window to see the following layout change from horizontal to vertical at 600px:

<Playground>
  <Responsive breakpoint={600}>
    <Flex style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>Hello</Flex>
    <Flex style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink"}}>World</Flex>
  </Responsive>
</Playground>

Another example is a common left right layout with buttons: 

<Playground>
  <Responsive breakpoint={650} minWidth={250}>
    <Horizontal sizing="flex">
      <demos.Button>Back 1</demos.Button>
      <demos.Button>Back 2</demos.Button>
    </Horizontal>
    <Horizontal sizing="flex" horizontalAlign="right">
      <demos.Button>Next 1</demos.Button>
      <demos.Button>Next 2</demos.Button>
    </Horizontal>
  </Responsive>
</Playground>
