# Containers

We have two general purpose *single child* containers `Flex` and `Content`. The ideas of *flex* and *content* are explained in the [sizing principle][principle-sizing]. If you have more than one child item, you probably want to use something like a [Vertical][vertical] or [Horizontal][horizontal].

# Flex
Flexes into the parent container.

In the example below, we have an explicit sized `Vertical` (background `lightskyblue`) with an inner `Flex` (background `darkorange`). The inner `Flex` keeps its size to match that of the outer container (observed below as you don't see the background of the parent as it is filled in by the child).

<Playground>
  <Vertical height={100} style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>
    <Flex style={{backgroundColor: "darkorange"}}>
        I'm taking up all the space from the parent
    </Flex>  
  </Vertical>
</Playground>

`sizing?: number` prop allows you to control the flex ratio (concept covered in [sizing principle][principle-sizing]) eg. a 1,2 ratio (`Horizontal(Flex:1,Flex:2)`) is shown below:

<Playground>
  <Horizontal height={100} spacing={0} style={{backgroundColor: "lightskyblue"}}>
    <Flex sizing={1} style={{backgroundColor: "darkorange"}}>
        I'm taking 1
    </Flex>  
    <Flex sizing={2} style={{backgroundColor: "lightpink"}}>
        I'm taking 2
    </Flex>
  </Horizontal>
</Playground>
