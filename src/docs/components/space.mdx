# Space

Space components add *space* to your designs. Spacers should not be abused, but they can be super handy. Consider a simple button on the screen: 

<Playground>
  <demos.Button>
    Just a button minding its own business
  </demos.Button>
</Playground>  

Let's say the design wants you to add some space on top of the button. You can do that easily with `margin-top`: 

<Playground>
  <demos.Button style={{marginTop: '25px'}}>
    Just a button minding its own business
  </demos.Button>
</Playground>  

We've covered issues with using margin (specifically their collapsing nature which makes them hard to manage and maintain reliably) in our [spacing-principle][principle-spacing]. Another issue is in the future this `marginTop` can easily get lost in code reviews. 

So instead you can use a simple `VerticalSpace`, which doesn't collapse (i.e. magically disappear), and shows up in code reviews: 

<Playground>
  <VerticalSpace space={25}/>
  <demos.Button>
    Just a button minding its own business
  </demos.Button>
</Playground>  

# HorizontalSpace
Takes the `space?:CSSLength` prop to generate a horizontal space. e.g. you can see the button pushed a bit to the right by a `HorizontalSpace`: 

<Playground>
  <HorizontalSpace space={25}/>
  <demos.Button>
    Just a button minding its own business
  </demos.Button>
</Playground>  

# VerticalSpace
Takes the `space?:CSSLength` prop to generate a vertical space. e.g. you can see the button pushed a bit to the bottom by a `VerticalSpace`: 

<Playground>
  <VerticalSpace space={25}/>
  <demos.Button>
    Just a button minding its own business
  </demos.Button>
</Playground>  

# FlexSpace 
Takes the `flex?:number` prop ([flex ratio concept covered in sizing principle][principle-sizing]) to generate a flex amount of space.

`FlexSpace` comes really handy when you want to split items to the sides (left & right) with a flex space in between as shown below:

<Playground>
  <Horizontal>
    <demos.Button>
      On left
    </demos.Button>
    <FlexSpace/>
    <demos.Button>
      On right
    </demos.Button>
  </Horizontal>
</Playground>

Here is a button pushed to the bottom of its parent `Vertical` by a preceding `FlexSpace`: 

<Playground>
  <Vertical height={100}>
    <FlexSpace/>
    <demos.Button>
      Just a button minding its own business
    </demos.Button>
  </Vertical>
</Playground>  

And here is a button pushed to the right of its parent `Horizontal` by a preceding `FlexSpace`: 

<Playground>
  <Horizontal>
    <FlexSpace/>
    <demos.Button>
      Just a button minding its own business
    </demos.Button>
  </Horizontal>
</Playground>

Note that when don't want to split items (all child items are grouped together), you can use the [alignment properties][common-types] on `Vertical`/`Horizontal` to achieve the same effect (no `FlexSpace` in the below example):

<Playground>
  <Horizontal horizontalAlign='right'>
    <demos.Button>
      Just a button minding its own business
    </demos.Button>
  </Horizontal>
</Playground>
