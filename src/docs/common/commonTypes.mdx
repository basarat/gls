# Common Types and Props
We have a common set of props that are supported by a number of components. These will be mentioned in the docs for the individual components as well. We present them below with a reference component.

Before we do that, we present some common types referenced by the props.

## BoxUnit
`type BoxUnit = number | string`. 

Examples: 
* 5 (implies 5px)
* '5rem'

## BoxSet

Various versions of providing common shorthand properties

```ts
export type BoxSet =
  /** top,right,left,bottom */
  | BoxUnit
  /** [topBottom,leftRight] */
  | [BoxUnit, BoxUnit]
  /** [top,right,bottom,left] */
  | [BoxUnit, BoxUnit, BoxUnit, BoxUnit]
```


## GLSProps
Objective: A consistent set of customization options. Members:

* `className?: string`: css class name.
* `padding?: BoxSet`: the padding.
* `scroll?: 'both' /** default */ | 'vertical' | 'horizontal' | 'disabled'`: specify scrolling behaviours.
* `styles?: typestyle.types.NestedCSSProperties[]`: any custom typestyle `style` objects you want to pass in.
