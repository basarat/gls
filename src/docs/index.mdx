# General Layout System
`gls` is a simple (but powerful) general purpose layout system for React 🌹. 

# CSS principles
There are a few key CSS principles developed with GLS for maintainable layouts in the world of components:

* Space principle
* Flex principle

# Components
All our components are just `div` elements (configurable to be a different tag) with atomic CSS generated by typestyle. 

* They take some custom properties as needed e.g. `spacing` and `padding` are common ones for layout parents.
* They support *all* the properties supported by a `div`.

You can now jump to individual docs for the components (like `Vertical`, `Horizontal` etc.) using the sidebar 👍🏻.
