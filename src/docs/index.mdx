# General Layout System
`gls` is a simple (but powerful) general purpose layout system for React 🌹. 

# CSS principles
There are a few key CSS principles developed with gls. These ideas are designed to help build maintainable layouts in the world of components:

* Space principle
* Flex principle

# Components
All our components are just browser native react tags (default `div`) with atomic CSS generated by typestyle. 

* They take some custom properties as needed e.g. `spacing` and `padding` are common ones for layout parents.
* They support *all* the properties supported by a `div`.

You can now jump to individual docs and demos using the sidebar. View them in order (recommended 👍🏻) or jump to whatever catches your eye 🕶.
