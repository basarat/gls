# General Layout System
`gls` is a simple (but powerful) general purpose layout system for React 🌹. 

# CSS principles
There are a few key CSS principles developed with gls. These ideas are designed to help build maintainable layouts in the world of components:

* Spacing principle
* Sizing principle
* Scrolling principle

# Components
All our components are just browser native react tags (default `div`) with atomic CSS generated by typestyle. They do not do any JavaScript execution or child element inspection and the layout system is powered by pure (and minimal) CSS resulting in high performance while still providing excellent developer ergonomics.

You can now jump to individual docs and demos using the sidebar. View them in order (recommended 👍🏻) or jump to whatever catches your eye 🕶.
